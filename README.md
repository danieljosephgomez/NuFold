Online Platform:
1. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kiharalab/nufold/blob/master/ColabNuFold.ipynb)
    * This implements quick rMSA due to a hardware limitation.

## Environment Setup and Installation

### 0. System requirements
The code was tested on the following environment.
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* CPU: modern x86_64 CPUs
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 24GB
    * VRAM requirement depends on the length of input RNA

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiharalab/NuFold.git
cd NuFold/
```

### 2. Conda Environment
Start by setting up a dedicated Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n nufold_P python=3.10
conda activate nufold_P
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
pip3 install ml-collections dm-tree deepspeed protobuf scipy biopython numpy matplotlib
```
* NuFold was trained with PyTorch `1.10.0+cu111`, and tested with PyTorch `2.0.1+cu117`.


### 3. third party software
#### 3.1. rMSA
Clone rMSA and set up the database by following the instruction of rMSA:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pylelab/rMSA
cd rMSA/
./database/script/update.sh
cd ../
```
* This may takes ~2 TB of disks, and a few hours to process. Please be patient.

#### 3.2. IPknot
IPknot is used for RNA secondary structure prediction. Download and set it up with the following commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/satoken/ipknot/releases/download/v1.1.0/ipknot-1.1.0-x86_64-linux.zip
unzip ipknot-1.1.0-x86_64-linux.zip && rm ipknot-1.1.0-x86_64-linux.zip
chmod +x ipknot-1.1.0-x86_64-linux/ipknot
```

## Model Checkpoint
Download the NuFold model checkpoint to a designated directory:

```bash
mkdir -p checkpoints
wget -O checkpoints/global_step145245.pt http://kiharalab.org/nufold/global_step145245.pt
```

## Running NuFold with the End-to-End Script
To run NuFold, you need to prepare the directory structure as following:
```
input_dir/
    [TARGET_ID]/
        [TARGET_ID].fasta
        [TARGET_ID].a3m
        [TARGET_ID].ipknot.ss
```

You can take a look at `test_input` directory, which have following structure.
```
test_input/
    2DER_C/
        2DER_C.fasta
        2DER_C.a3m
        2DER_C.ipknot.ss
```
To generate those files, you can follow the steps below

### 1. Run rMSA
First, generate the MSA with following command:
```
rMSA/rMSA.pl test_input/2DER_C/2DER_C.fasta -cpu=32
cp test_input/2DER_C/2DER_C.afa test_input/2DER_C/2DER_C.a3m
```
This step may take a couple of hours to a half day, depends on the target sequence.

### 2. Run IPknot
```
ipknot-1.1.0-x86_64-linux/ipknot test_input/2DER_C/2DER_C.fasta > test_input/2DER_C/2DER_C.ipknot.ss
```
This step typically takes a few seconds.

### 3. Run NuFold
To run NuFold inference, you can use following command:
```
python3 run_nufold.py \
  --ckpt_path checkpoints/global_step145245.pt \
  --input_fasta test_input/2DER_C/2DER_C.fasta \
  --input_dir test_input/ \
  --output_dir test_output \
  --config_preset initial_training
```
This step will take up to ~5 minutes.
Your result will be found at `test_output/2DER_C/2DER_C_rank_1.pdb`.
